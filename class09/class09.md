### Final projects
No more assignments, final projects start NOW. For next week, prepare a small presentation: inspirations, idea, prototype(?), images, etc.

### Pixel array
Available to videos and images, the method `.loadPixels()` gives you an array of pixels. The `get()` method gives you the color of a certain `(x, y)` location, but the array has the matrix "unrolled".

### Programming for your phone!
`touchIsDown` is the simile to `mouseDown`

`displayWidth` and `displayHeight` are useful to fill the display!
