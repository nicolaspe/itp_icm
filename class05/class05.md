### Variable scope
In Javascript, when you have a *code block*, a.k.a. anything between `{` & `}`, and you define a variable with `let` inside, it only exists within that code block.

If there are two variables with the same name, it will use the one created inside that code block.

If inside the code block, you call a variable and it doesn't exist, it will create it as a global variable.

Until recently, Javascript did not have *lexical scope*!

- `let` has *lexical scope*
- `var` has *function scope*

### Assignment
Use arrays! Add, remove objects, use keypresses, mouse clicks, etc... As we have a makeup class on Friday, combine it with HTML controls ðŸ˜ƒ
