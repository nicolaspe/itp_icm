# Intro to Comp Media - Sept 20

### Outline
1. Homework + questions
2. Contingent behavior
3. Repetition
4. A draggable circle


### Questions

##### Mouse clicking
With the built-in variables, we can keep track of many things. One way is with `mouseIsPressed`, a boolean variable; or with the `mousePressed()` function. The variable is useful to **draw** things, and the function to **control** other behaviours (changing/updating variables).

### Repetition
Repetition already happens in the `draw()` function: animation, interaction, time.
But we can also have repetition in our code for other things, like repetitions in space. This is done via the `for` loop.
