# Intro to Comp Media - Sept 20

### Outline
1. Homework + questions
2. Contingent behaviour
3. Repetition
4. A draggable circle


### Questions
**Mouse clicking**:
With the built-in variables, we can keep track of many things. One way is with `mouseIsPressed`, a boolean variable; or with the `mousePressed()` function. The variable is useful to **draw** things, and the function to **control** other behaviours (changing/updating variables).


### Contingent behaviour
Sometimes we want the script to make a decision. Programs usually run as a straight line, from start to end (and then the `draw()` functions repeats itself). But we can add different "paths" with conditional statement. This is done with the `if`/`else` clauses. You can combine the boolean operations with the logical operators "and" `&&` and "or" `||`. You can mix them, but it is better to use parenthesis; otherwise it gets mixed up.


### Repetition
Repetition already happens in the `draw()` function: animation, interaction, time.
But we can also have repetition in our code for other things, like repetitions in space. This is done via the `for` loop.

### Draggable thingies!


### Assignment
Create an interactive artwork that implements the concept of repetition with variation. Use at least one for loop. Your artwork should also incorporate an interactive interface element of your own design. For this assignment, **work in pairs**. Write a blog post with a link to your sketch and a description of your experience. Things to try:

- Make a rollover, a button, or a slider from scratch. Compare your code to the examples in "Examples" below. Later we'll look at how this compare to interface elements we'll get for free from the browser.
- Create an algorithmic design with simple parameters. (One example is 10 PRINT, see: 10PRINT example). Make your interface element control the appearance or behavior of the algorithmic design.
- When working in teams, try working separately and then combining your work together. Overlay your sketches, or have the interface element you created control your partner's algorithmic design (and vice versa). Trade sketches and riff on your partner's work. Or, sit next to each other at one keyboard and take turns coding while looking over each other's shoulder.
